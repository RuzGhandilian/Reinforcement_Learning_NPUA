# NPUA Reinforcement Learning Course Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a series of projects developed as part of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) course at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA). The projects are based on the foundational concepts presented in *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Sutton and Barto. Each project focuses on implementing and analyzing key RL algorithms, with an emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical application.
## Projects Overview
### Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game implementation
- Implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe environment.
- Reinforcement Learning agent.
- Ability to play against the trained AI.
### Project 2: Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
- Exploration of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of the multi-armed bandit problem.
- Implementation and comparison of strategies such as Îµ-greedy algorithm, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and gradient bandit algorithms.
- Comparison of Optimistic Initial Values and Realistic Initial Values


## Each project directory contains:
- **code/**: Source code for the implementation.
- **results/**: Experimental results, including plots, tables, and analysis.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation specific to the project, including setup instructions, methodology, and key findings.
