# NPUA Reinforcement Learning Course Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a series of projects developed as part of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) course at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA). The projects are based on the foundational concepts presented in *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Sutton and Barto. Each project focuses on implementing and analyzing key RL algorithms, with an emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical application.

- Exploration of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of the multi-armed bandit problem.
- Comparison of Optimistic Initial Values and Realistic Initial Values
- Implementation and comparison of strategies such as ε-greedy algorithm, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and gradient bandit algorithms.

###  Project 3: [Markov Decision Process](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Reinforcement_Learning_NPUA/tree/master/gridworld-mdp) (MDP) in Grid-World
- Implementation of **policy evaluation** and **value iteration** for a 5×5 grid-world.  
- Visualization of value function convergence under random and optimal policies.  
- Demonstration of Bellman equations in finite MDPs.  

###  Project 4: [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Reinforcement_Learning_NPUA/tree/master/gridworld-dp) Dynamic Programming (DP) in Grid-World  
- **Policy evaluation** and **improvement** in a 4×4 grid-world with terminal states.  
- Comparison of **in-place** vs. **out-of-place** DP updates.  
- Theoretical analysis of policy improvement guarantees.
