# NPUA Reinforcement Learning Course Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects completed during the Reinforcement Learning (RL) course at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA). The projects demonstrate the application of foundational RL algorithms to solve various problems, ranging from simple decision-making tasks to complex environments. Each project is structured to reflect theoretical understanding, practical implementation, and experimental analysis.

## Projects Overview
### Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game implementation
- Implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe environment.
- Reinforcement Learning agent.
- Ability to play against the trained AI.
