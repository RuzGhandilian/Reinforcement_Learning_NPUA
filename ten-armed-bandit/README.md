# Multi-Armed Bandit Reinforcement Learning Project

This project simulates the behavior of a multi-armed bandit problem using epsilon-greedy strategies. It generates plots to visualize the average reward and percentage of optimal actions over time for different epsilon values.

---
## Features
- Simulates multi-armed bandit problems with customizable epsilon values.
- Generates plots for average reward and percentage of optimal actions.
- Supports sample-averages and constant step-size methods for action-value estimation.

---
## How It Works
1. **Bandit Class**: Implements the epsilon-greedy algorithm for action selection and updates action values based on rewards.
2. **Simulation**: Runs multiple independent runs with different epsilon values and calculates mean rewards and optimal actions.
3. **Plotting**: Visualizes the results using `matplotlib` and saves the plots as high-resolution images.

## Requirements

## Results 
### Greedy Action Selection VS ε-greedy Action Selection

1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Higher epsilon (`ε = 0.10`) leads to more exploration, which helps discover better actions early but reduces long-term performance.
   - Lower epsilon (`ε = 0.01`) leads to better long-term results. The percentage of optimal actions increases steadily and converges to a higher value, indicating a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
   - Greedy strategy (`ε = 0.00`) performs poorly because it lacks exploration.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - A small amount of exploration (`ε = 0.01`) is optimal for maximizing both average reward and the percentage of optimal actions over time.

### 3. Optimistic Initial Values VS Realistic Initial Values

The simulation calculates the percentage of optimal actions over time for each bandit. The results are plotted as follows:
- **Bandit 1 (`ε = 0, 𝑄₁(𝑎) = 5`)**: Represents a greedy strategy with optimistic initial values.
- **Bandit 2 (`ε = 0.1, 𝑄₁(𝑎) = 0`)**: Represents an epsilon-greedy strategy with realistic initial values.
